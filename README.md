# PackageFileSearch
PackageFileSearch is plugin designed to allow a user to search all default, installed, and unpacked plugins for specific files.

I have no intention to put this on Package Control at this time.  This is more of a personal plugin.  A good alternative is https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/PackageResourceViewer which is available via Package Control.
